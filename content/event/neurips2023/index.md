summary: Paper on unifying the seemingly different frameworks for constructing diffusion bridges, and improving them with data consistency, was accepted to  NeurIPS 2023.
abstract: Paper titled "Direct Diffusion Bridges using Data Consistency for Inverse Problems" is accepted to NeurIPS 2023. We unify the seemingly different frameworks into one, under the name direct diffusion bridges. We further move on to propose data consistent direct diffusion bridge, which can push the pareto-frontier forward by imposing data consistency.
