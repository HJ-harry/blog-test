summary: Paper on accelerating conditional diffusion models accepted to CVPR 2022
abstract: Paper titled "Come-Closer-Diffuse-Faster Accelerating Conditional Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems through Stochastic Contraction" is accepted to CVPR 2022. We study the stochastically contracting property of reverse diffusion, and leverage this property to significantly accelerate diffusion model based linear inverse problem solvers.
