## 📚 Welcome to my Homepage

Welcome to my personal homepage. I am an ongoing **Ph.D. student @KAIST**. The motivation of my research is **"Making invisible, visible"**. Mostly, I work on solving **inverse problems** arising in computational imaging, and I focus on using **deep learning**, especially unsupervised learning methods to accomplish it. Unlike many works in literature that simply adopt published methods off-the-shelf, I also try to delve on theoretical links of machine learning and signal processing.
