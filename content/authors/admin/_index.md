**Research Scientist, advisory member** at [EverEx](https://everex.kr/), and a final year **Ph.D. candidate @KAIST** [bio-imaging signal processing & learning lab (BISPL)](https://bispl.weebly.com/). Prior research intern at NVIDIA Research, Google Research, and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Diffusion models and inverse problems enthusiast. Hyungjin has pioneered and advanced some of the most widely acknowledged works on diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers. Interested broadly in the intersection of generative models, representation learning, and their applications to real-world problems. Here is my [CV](https://github.com/HJ-harry/blog-test/blob/master/static/media/CV_Hyungjin_Chung.pdf) and [Research Statement](https://github.com/HJ-harry/blog-test/blob/master/static/media/Research_Statement_Hyungjin_Chung.pdf).

I am looking for highly motivated researchers to work with me at [EverEx](https://everex.kr/). If you are interested, send me an email with your CV attached.
