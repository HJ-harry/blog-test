Final year **Ph.D. student @KAIST** [bio-imaging signal processing & learning lab (BISPL)](https://bispl.weebly.com/). Prior research intern at NVIDIA Research, Google Research Perception (LUMA), and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) applied math and plasma physics group (T-5). Diffusion models and inverse problems enthusiast. Hyungjin Chung has pioneered and advanced some of the most widely acknowledged works on diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers. My research interests include, but are not restricted to advancing and widening the applicability of diffusion models in inverse imaging, applications to solve real-world problems (e.g. medical imaging).
